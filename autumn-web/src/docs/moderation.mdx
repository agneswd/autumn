# Core Moderation

Primary moderation commands used for user actions and channel cleanup.

Autumn supports both prefix and slash commands. Examples below use prefix syntax.

## `!ban`
Permanently bans a user from the current server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!ban <user> [reason]
```

**Permission required:** `Ban Members`

---

## `!kick`
Removes a user from the current server without banning them.

**Usage:**
```bash
!kick <user> [reason]
```

**Permission required:** `Kick Members`

---

## `!timeout`
Applies a communication timeout to a user.

**Usage:**
```bash
!timeout <user> [duration] [reason]
```

**Permission required:** `Moderate Members`

**Duration notes:**
- Default timeout is `10m` if duration is omitted.
- Supports compact durations like `30s`, `10m`, `2h`, `1d`.
- Supports chained durations like `1h10m`.

**Prefix parsing examples:**
```bash
!timeout @user 30m spam
!timeout @user 1h10m repeated violations
!timeout @user 1h 30m -- reason can start with numbers like 10
```

---

## `!warn`
Records a warning for a user in the current server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!warn <user> [reason]
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Messages`

---

## `!purge`
Deletes recent messages in the current channel.

**Usage:**
```bash
!purge <amount>
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Messages`

`amount` must be at least `1`. The command internally caps deletion for safety.

---

## `!terminate`
Dangerous action: bans a user and performs native Discord message cleanup window handling.

**Usage:**
```bash
!terminate <user> [period] [reason]
```

**Permissions required:** `Ban Members` + `Manage Messages`

This command uses a moderator confirmation flow before execution.

---

## `!permissions`
Shows **your own** effective server permissions in a paginated list.

**Usage:**
```bash
!permissions [page]
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Messages`
