## `!unban`
Removes a ban for a user.

**Usage:**

If the user is not currently banned in this server, the command exits without applying changes.

---

## `!untimeout`
Removes an active timeout from a user.

**Usage:**
```bash

## `!unwarn`
Removes one warning or all warnings for a target user.

**Usage:**
```bash

```

**Permission required:** `Manage Messages`
