# Contributing to Autumn

Thanks for your interest in improving Autumn.

Contributions are welcome across code, docs, testing, bug reports, and UX feedback.

## How to Contribute

### 1) Report a Bug or Request a Feature
If you found an issue or have an improvement idea, open an issue first:

- [Autumn Issues](https://github.com/agneswd/autumn/issues)

When possible, include:
- expected behavior
- actual behavior
- reproduction steps
- environment/context

### 2) Submit a Pull Request
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a focused branch:
	 ```bash
	 git checkout -b feature/my-change
	 ```
3. Implement your change with minimal unrelated edits.
4. Run relevant checks before opening the PR.
5. Commit with clear messages.
6. Push and open a PR with a concise description.

## Development Standards

### Rust (bot/backend)
- Format code with:
	```bash
	cargo fmt
	```
- Validate with:
	```bash
	cargo build
	cargo clippy
	```
- Keep command handlers thin and place DB logic in the database layer.

### Frontend (website)
- Keep component/layout updates consistent with existing design.
- Avoid large UX refactors unless they are part of the requested scope.

### Documentation
- Keep command usage synchronized with the actual command metadata.
- If command behavior or arguments change, update the docs in `autumn-web/src/docs/`.
