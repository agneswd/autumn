# Setup & Configuration

Configuration commands for moderation logging and staff visibility.

Autumn supports both prefix and slash commands. Examples below use prefix syntax.

## `!modlogchannel`
Set, view, or clear the moderation log channel for the current server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!modlogchannel [#channel|channel_id|clear]
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Server`

**Examples:**
```bash
!modlogchannel #mod-logs
!modlogchannel 123456789012345678
!modlogchannel clear
!modlogchannel
```

**What it does:**
- With a channel mention or channel ID, stores that channel as the server modlog target.
- With `clear`, removes the stored modlog channel.
- With no argument, shows the currently configured modlog channel.

If no modlog channel is configured, moderation actions still work; they just won’t be mirrored to a dedicated modlog channel.

## `!userlogchannel`
Set, view, or clear the channel used for user message activity logs.

**Usage:**
```bash
!userlogchannel [#channel|channel_id|clear]
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Server`

**Examples:**
```bash
!userlogchannel #user-logs
!userlogchannel 123456789012345678
!userlogchannel clear
!userlogchannel
```

**What it tracks once configured:**
- Message edits
- Message deletions
- Attachment/image deletions

## `!wordfilter`
Manage the word filter for this server. Automatically detects and acts on messages containing filtered words.

**Subcommands:**

**`!wordfilter enable`**
Enable the word filter.

**`!wordfilter disable`**
Disable the word filter.

**`!wordfilter action <log|delete|warn|timeout>`**
Set the action taken when a filtered word is detected:
- **log** — Only log the violation to the modlog channel
- **delete** — Delete the message and log the violation
- **warn** — Warn the user, delete the message, and log the violation
- **timeout** — Timeout the user (5 min), delete the message, and log the violation

**`!wordfilter preset <load|clear>`**
Load or clear a curated preset list of commonly offensive words.

**`!wordfilter add <word>`**
Add a custom word to the filter list. Duplicates are rejected.

**`!wordfilter remove <word>`**
Remove a word from the filter list.

**`!wordfilter list`**
Display all currently filtered words (paginated).

**Permission required:** `Manage Server`

All subcommands also work as slash commands (e.g. `/wordfilter enable`).

---

## `!aitoggle`
Enable or disable AI mention replies for the current server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!aitoggle <on|off|status>
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Server`

**Examples:**
```bash
!aitoggle status
!aitoggle off
!aitoggle on
```

When set to `off`, Autumn will ignore mention-triggered LLM replies for that guild even if Ollama is configured.
