# Setup & Configuration

Configuration commands for moderation logging and staff visibility.

Autumn supports both prefix and slash commands. Examples below use prefix syntax.

## `!modlogchannel`
Set, view, or clear the moderation log channel for the current server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!modlogchannel [#channel|channel_id|clear]
```

**Permission required:** `Manage Server`

**Examples:**
```bash
!modlogchannel #mod-logs
!modlogchannel 123456789012345678
!modlogchannel clear
!modlogchannel
```

**What it does:**
- With a channel mention or channel ID, stores that channel as the server modlog target.
- With `clear`, removes the stored modlog channel.
- With no argument, shows the currently configured modlog channel.

If no modlog channel is configured, moderation actions still work; they just won’t be mirrored to a dedicated modlog channel.
